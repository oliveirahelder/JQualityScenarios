## 🎯 The 5 New Features

### 1. **Real-Time Sync Status** ⏱️
See when sprint data was last synced from Jira. DevOps can manually refresh on demand.

### 2. **Code Impact Analysis** 🔴🟡🔵
Instantly see which code areas changed per ticket, color-coded by risk level (High/Medium/Standard)

### 3. **Test Scenario Coverage** 🧪
QA sees which tickets need test scenarios at a glance. Identifies gaps immediately.

### 4. **Documentation Pipeline** 📄
Real-time visibility into document publishing: Draft → Review → Approved → Published

### 5. **Enhanced Ticket Table** ✨
More relevant columns replacing generic "PRs" with actionable "Impact" and "Scenarios" data.

## ✅ Why This Matters

### Before
- QA couldn't see what code changed
- No visibility into test coverage gaps
- Documentation status unknown
- Data sync timing unclear

### After
- ✅ QA sees code impact & risk level instantly
- ✅ Test coverage gaps identified in seconds
- ✅ Documentation pipeline visible in real-time
- ✅ Data freshness known at all times
